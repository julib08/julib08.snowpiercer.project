	<h2> Background Context of the Hit show "Snowpiercer" </h2>
<body>
	<p> If you have not yet seen season 1 of the TNT hit show "Snowpiercer," you are truly missing out. The show is based on the 2013 movie with the same title. The show takes place in a dystopian future society, where Global warming has become so bad, that scientists attempted to cool the earth with powerful freeze technology, but they way overshot this idea and accidentley sent the earth into an ice age. The earth is now so cold that it cannot sustain life as tempatures range from -100 to -250 <b>F</b> on all parts of the globe. However, one man, Mr.Wilford, predicted that this would happen and built a circumnavigation train that eternally circles the frozen earth. The train is known as Snowpiercer, as it has an eternal engine that is powered by converting the snow and ice on the track to power for the train, thus it could never run out of fuel.
	</p>
	<p> While the idea of Snowpiercer is awesome, it could not take every person who was alive during the time that the world froze over. The only people who were fortunate to purchase tickets to the train were the ones who were mainly responisble for raising the global tempature in the first place. Many found this to be incredibly unfair, so when the train was leaving, a large group pf people snuck onto the back of the train. These people will later be known as the "Tallies." On snowpiercer, the society is divided into different classes. There is first class, second class, third class and what is known as the "Tail/Tallies."

	<h3> The plot of Snowpiercer </h3>
	<p> By this point, you are probably wondering what the show is actually about, as the above paragraph was just setting the scene for the show. Well let me tell you. The plotline is what I think makes the show truly amazing, as it is thorough and will not leave you bored. As I have already explained, the train is broken into class systems. These class systems essentially dicate what your quality of life will be on the train. Thus speaking, First class has it the best, while second and third have slightly less ammenities respectfully, but it is the tail who has it the aboluste worst.  </p> 
	<p> The people of the tail are not fed realy food, but insteaad processed bars made of bugs and they live in absolute filth, as they were not intended to ever be there in the first place. After many years of living like this, the people of the tail feel that it is their time to recieve proper living conditions, so they begin a revolution. This revolution is the main storyline of season 1 of the show. </p>
	
	Now you're probably wondering why just exactly this show is so amazing. Well, to start, the cast of the show is amazing. It features Daveed Diggs, Jennifer Connelley and Sean Bean as main characters in the show. Each of these actors/actresses are amazing on their own, but to see them working on a TV show altogether makes it even more enjoyable.
	
    <p> Another personal reason that I enjoy this show so much is that it is not predictable. When watching the series, I had no idea what was going to happen at the end and I was truly shocked. I feel like today many TV shows are pretty predicitable, so it was a nice to change to have a show be unpredictable. </p>
